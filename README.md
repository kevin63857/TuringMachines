# TuringMachines

This project can be somewhat divided into 3 parts ->

1) Implement a Turing Machine simulator in Python, with a graphical represention.  Probably load Turing Machines and starting input from a YAML file
2) Create Turing Machines to perform basic opperations on ~5 Registers and infinite memory -> These basic opperations will be representable with basic assembly instructions.  How many and which ones are still TBD.
3) Create a Turing Machine that will incorporate the previously designed machines together, and essentially just run the assembly instructions.  This machine will basically simulate a microprocessor that runs assembly code.

Some useful things that I have decided about this project:
